# Generating JSON
Every semester, the JSON should be re-generated from the Google Sheets roster. This is easy because the JSON corresponds closely to the format of the roster; with an editor that has multi-cursor support, it will take you 5-15 minutes.  Watch "Generating JSON.webm" in the Epsilon folder at 2x speed to see how this works. Remember to update the "img" boolean to reflect whether or not each brother's composite photo has been uploaded.
